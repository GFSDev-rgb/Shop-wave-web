### Firebase Setup

2. Enable the **Firestore Database** and **Firebase Authentication** (with Email/Password and Google providers).
3. Go to your Project Settings and copy the web app configuration.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...
   ```
5. **(Optional) Set up an Admin User:**
   The admin user is currently hardcoded to be `emammahadi822@gmail.com`. You can change this in `src/context/auth-context.tsx` or create a user with this email to access the admin dashboard.

### Genkit AI Setup
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get a Gemini API key.

The application will automatically seed the Firestore database with initial product data on its first run if the `products` collection is empty.
